# 5. Deployment Cycle
[Go to the top](#UX) <a name="UX"></a>

There were a few elements that were changed, re-positioned or added from my original wireframes as they were more appropriate for the user.

#### All pages
* I added a Youtube link as I had provided a youtube video on the landing page. Allows the user to do further research on what the website is about.

#### Landing page
* The original wireframe was missing something which would engage users. I embedded a youtube video to allow the user to feel enticed and reduce the attention from the text. The video is appropriate and fits the page perfectly.

#### Contact page
* The original wireframes did not include any location or instant contact for the user, which could lead to confusion and hassle. To avoid this I embedded google maps with a pinpoint which provided users of the location and the map allows them to see any local POI's.
* A phone nymber is placed at the bottom of the map if the user is interested in instant communication.
* Contact content remained the same but I added a hover animation over each box to avoid user confusion when filling out and also make it visually pleasing.

#### Future Implements
* Create a weekly newsletter where users can sign up to, to view any news or updates about the website.
