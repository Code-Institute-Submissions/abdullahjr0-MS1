        <p>At AJR Fitness, it’s all about celebrating endorphins. We love the feeling you get at the end of a really good workout, and we love being able to see the benefits afterwards.

        For us, it’s not enough that we provide our clients with a dynamic, energising exercise programme that delivers results fast. It’s also important that we provide an experience that’s welcoming, positive and enjoyable.</p>
        
        <p>Everything we do at AJR Fitness is designed to help us achieve these goals.</p>
        
        <p>So our Trainers are among the most expert (and the most highly trained) you’ll find anywhere. They’re chosen as much for their attitude and approach as for their expertise.
        We also have our own in-house Physiotherapists (we’re recognised by all the major private health insurance companies) and Sports Massage Therapists.
        Being part of the AJR Fitness experience couldn’t be easier. We make it easy to train when you want, how you want. We’re open seven days a week (weekdays, from early to late). And we don’t charge membership or joining fees.
