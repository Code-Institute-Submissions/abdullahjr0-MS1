          <br>
         <p>At AJR Fitness, it’s all about celebrating endorphins. We love the feeling you get at the end of a really good workout, and we love being able to see the benefits afterwards.

         For us, it’s not enough that we provide our clients with a dynamic, energising exercise programme that delivers results fast. It’s also important that we provide an experience that’s welcoming, positive and enjoyable.</p>
        
         <p>Everything we do at AJR Fitness is designed to help us achieve these goals.</p>
        
          <p>So our Trainers are among the most expert (and the most highly trained) you’ll find anywhere. They’re chosen as much for their attitude and approach as for their expertise.
          We also have our own in-house Physiotherapists (we’re recognised by all the major private health insurance companies) and Sports Massage Therapists.
          Being part of the AJR Fitness experience couldn’t be easier. We make it easy to train when you want, how you want and we don’t charge membership or joining fees. Check our Services page for training times.

            Alexis has been part of the AJRF Community since December 2019 making exceptional progress in her mobility and strength, but as of January this year, she really switched gears with her focus, dropping an incredible 9kilos in 12 weeks.
            
            I’m so happy and proud of what Alexis has achieved. She has shown tremendous determination despite extremely challenging times.”

            I've been training with AJRF for about 6 weeks now. Originally, 
            I only wanted to work on my form for one or two exercises before going back to training on my own, but I'm not sure that will ever happen now... :D
            
            AJRF provide an enormous amount of knowledge, helping to fix my shoulder / chest issue and other imbalances
            and massively increasing my confidence!”
